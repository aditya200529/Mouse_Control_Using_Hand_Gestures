# Mouse_Control_Using_Hand_Gestures
This project implements a virtual mouse system that allows users to control the mouse cursor using real-time hand gestures captured through a webcam. 
By leveraging computer vision and hand landmark detection, the system translates finger movements and gestures into mouse actions such as cursor movement, clicks, and scrolling—eliminating the need for a physical mouse.

The application uses OpenCV for video processing and MediaPipe for accurate hand tracking and landmark detection. Specific gestures are mapped to mouse events, enabling smooth and intuitive human–computer interaction. This project demonstrates the practical use of gesture recognition, real-time image processing, and AI-based interaction systems.
